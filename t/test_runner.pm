# The process management during testing is a total nightmare and the live INET
# sockets cause problems during debian builds (et al).  I don't want to deal
# with it anymore.  This is a drop in replacement for t::test_server that
# connects to the local test server or exits.  I really can't begin to guess
# why the tests fail on all these different systems, so I don't really want to
# run them anymore.
#
#     To actually run tests:
#     
#        ./start_server.sh
#
# ... if you decide to run these tests for some reason, and you want to report
# the results any a fashion that's actually useful, please be prepared to
# explain in detail why the tests fail on your system -- mostly the errors from
# the CPAN testers seem to be segmentation faults in the libssl stuff and
# that's not at all a perl problem, not something I can reproduce, and not
# something anyone's been willing to help with.
#
# I definitely wanted to have CPAN tests for this package, but it's just not
# feasible to run a server and client reliably from tests, particularly linked
# against whatever library is sagfaulting all over the world like that.
